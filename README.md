Microsoft Stock Price Prediction with LSTM
Overview:
* This project uses historical stock data for Microsoft (MSFT) to build a machine learning model that predicts future stock prices.

* The model is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, which are effective for time series forecasting tasks.

Features:
* Data Preprocessing: Cleans and formats historical stock data for SMFT from 2013 onwards.

* Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations for trends, seasonality, and correlation among stock price features.

* Model Training: Implementation of an LSTM model to learn patterns in Microsoft stock price movements.

* Stock Price Prediction: Forecasts the closing prices for the next 30 days using the trained model.

* Result Visualization: Plots predicted prices against actual data for clear comparison and performance analysis.

* Date-wise Output: Predicted values are shown with corresponding dates for straightforward interpretation and analysis.

Getting Started
* Clone this repository.

* Place your MicrosoftStock.csv historical data file in the root folder.

* Install required dependencies: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow (or keras).

* Run the notebook or script to preprocess data, train the LSTM model, and view predictions.

Project Structure:
* MicrosoftStock.csv: Historical price data for Microsoft stock.

* stock_price_prediction.ipynb or .py: Main notebook/script containing data processing, model implementation, and visualization.

* Output visualizations and prediction results.

How It Works:
* The model uses Microsoftâ€™s daily open, high, low, close, and volume data.

* A sliding window approach prepares the data for LSTM, which learns sequential trends.

* The predicted output is presented in a date-wise DataFrame or CSV for easy integration or sharing.

Applications:
* Helps investors and analysts forecast Microsoft stock movement.

* Demonstrates application of deep learning in financial time series analysis.

* Can be adapted for other stocks with similar data.
